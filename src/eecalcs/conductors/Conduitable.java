run test of ampacity of cable and conductors when sharing same conduit and after removing/adding more from/to conduit
    done for cables
    quede aqui: do it for conductors

add cases to cable (depending on cable type, how ampacity is calculated). Refer to my notes about what I read on the NEC.
add cases to conduit (depending on type, how sizes are calculated, min sizes, restriction, etc, read the code)

implement circuit, load, OCDP, Panel
circuit is a conduitable, but a circuit might be composed of conductors or cables, not both.
Access to this cable or conductors is restricted from outside.
The size of the conductor is calculated based on conditions, locations, temperature, ccc, metal, etc.
number of individual conductors or the number of conductors in the cable must match the system voltage and wiring

Another way of implementing this is:
    Circuit uses a cable or conductors, not both.
