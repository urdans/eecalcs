package eecalcs.conductors;
/*
The class encapsulates only static data and static methods. This class is to be used in composition by the
class Conductor.
Class Circuit should inherit from Conductor
Class Feeder, Branch and Service should inherit from class Circuit
Class Load is for generic loads. Other load types should inherit from class Load and get specialized.

This class groups all the properties related to a conductor of a defined size. The class is able to build and return any conductor with
all these properties (as defined in NEC2014) and also build a conductor object (as defined below) that encapsulates only the
properties that pertain to a particular set of conditions.

Other classes should be defined separately; Composition will be preferred above inheritance, unless abstraction is necessary (which will
probably be the case for the class load and its descendant)

A conductor is an entity that encapsulates all the properties of a single conductor, when it is isolated, that is, the
represented characteristics don't depend upon other conditions, like ambient temperature, number of conductor per raceway, type of
raceway, voltage type (AC or DC), number of phases, special locations, load types, etc.

Class Conductor:
----------------
The independent properties of a conductor are:
-size
-metal (CU or AL)
-insulation (if any)
-length (one way length)

Class Circuit:
-----------------------
The resistance and reactance of the conductor will depend on the raceway type and arrangement:
-If conductors are in free air or tray
-If they are inside a conduit and then, the metal of the conduit
-The number of conductors inside the raceway that are not in parallel (this should affect the resistance and the reactance of the
conductor but I haven't found a formulae or method that correlates these characteristics)
-The number of conductors inside the conduit that are in parallel (same note as before; table 9 is based on the assumption the system
voltage is three phase, 75Â°C, 60Hz, three single conductors in conduit; so, unless more information is found, I will always use the
values of table 9 but will leave room for improvement once the method that considers different scenarios is found).

-The ampacity of the conductor will depend mainly on all the above listed variables but also on the location of the conductor, like when
it is in the rooftop (and the distance from the floor)


Class Feeder, Service, Branch and Tap:
--------------------------------------
-These classes are similar. They differ in the fact that the branch circuit directly feeds a load, while a feeder has a OCPD on each end.
A special Feeder is the Service class.
SOme of the properties of these classes are:
-Voltage
-Phases,
-Frequency

The user must put the class CircuitConductor in the context of any of the classes Feeder, Service or Branch.

For instance, the Branch class has a load object. The Feeder has a load intent. One or more branch circuits will always be connected to a
feeder through an OCPD.

Branch circuits can be multiwire
Loads can be continuous or non continuous.

Other classes must be designed, like for fuses, breakers, loads, motors, appliances, whatever, lights, AC equipment, panel, switchboard,
etc, etc.
