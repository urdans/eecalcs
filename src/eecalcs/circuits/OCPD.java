/**
 This class represents an OverCurrent Protection Device when providing
 simultaneous protection against short-circuit, ground-fault and overload.<br>
 The class provides the following services:<br>
 <ol>
 <li>Static methods for:
 <ul>
 <li>Proving the list of all standard ratings.</li>
 <li>Choosing the proper OCPD rating based on the given maximum value passed
 and if the next higher standard rating rule can or cannot be applied.</li>
 <li>Providing a list of device types (fuse, circuit breaker...)</li>
 </ul></li>

 <li>The OCPD rating of a circuit must be determined as follows:
 always uses the load's OCPD rating as maximum rating unless its value is
 zero (which means no particular OCPD rating is required), in which case
 the OCPD rating must be determined to protect the conductors only.</li>
 </ol>
