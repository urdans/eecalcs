 * This class encapsulates a message. A message is a string text explaining a
 * condition to the user. An unique number is associated with a message.
 * ResultMessage objects are usually returned by objects that perform calculations.
 * If the message's number is negative, it must be interpreted as an error
 * message. If this number is positive it must be interpreted as a warning.
 * A number equals to zero has no meaning and eventually can be used to indicate
 * a neutral message, like a "status".
